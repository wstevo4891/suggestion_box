#AngularJS Suggestion Box Project

A simple AngularJS app that allows users to post workplace suggestions to the home page, 
comment on posts, and upvote both posts and comments.

I built this app for the Codecademy-Pro AngularJS final project.

Thanks to the eyedropper tool, I was able to build a CSS layout nearly identical to
the example photo provided for the project.

#Installation

Git clone, navigate to the root directory, and launch a server by typing "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"

No need to link angular.js and angular-route.js, they're included.
